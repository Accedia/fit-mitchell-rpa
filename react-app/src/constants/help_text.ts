The import data for the application comes from REV Consumables.\n\n#### NOTE: Moving the mouse, or clicking any mouse button, or clicking any key on the keyboard will result in errors in the data going into the estimate.\n\n## General notes\n\n1. The Import Application is started by clicking a \"Commit\" button in REV Consumables. Commit buttons are available on the “Download Log” page, “Import Details” page, and the \"Review / Commit\" page.\n2. You can start the population as many times as needed for different forgettables without restarting the application. However, only one Consumable import can run at a time.\n3. New updates of the Import Application will be downloaded and installed automatically.\n\n## How to use\n### Section 1. Finding and choosing forgettables\n\n1. Navigate to REV Estimatics.\n2. Select an estimate in the “Estimates to Enhance” list. The line will turn blue.\n3. Double click the line or click the “Enhance Estimate” button.\n4. Click the “Consumables” button.\n5.

Both the estimating system, showing the target estimate, and REV must be open on your desktop at the same time before an import begins. They can be started in either order (estimating system first then REV, or the REV first then the estimating system) as long as both are open when you  click a Commit button.\n2. In REV Consumables, select “Download Log / Edit” in the “Resources” dropdown list at the right top of the page.\n3. Select the estimate line with the consumables you want to transfer – the line will turn blue.\n4. There are two ways to Commit this selected estimate:\na.

Click “Commit – Add to Estimate” at top of the page to Commit immediately without further editing.\nEither way, the Commit Dialog will open.\n5. In the Commit Dialog, Select “Commit – Add to Estimate” and click Continue.\n6. In the Select Type of Transfer - select either Itemized or Bundled:\na. The Itemized selection transfers all consumable line items you have selected.\nb. The Bundled selection transfers a single summary line with the total dollars of all consumables.\n7. Make sure that the estimating system is open and the same estimate is showing.\n8. Still in the “Select Type of Transfer” window, click the “Commit – Add to Estimate” button. The import process will begin immediately.\n\n### Section 3. Completing the Import Process\n\n1. If the browser prompts you, then click on \"Open REV Input Automation\" button on the popup.\n2. The application will display \"Detecting Estimate window\".\n3. The population will start after the “Commit” button in REV Estimatics is clicked.\n4.

When the population is complete, REV Consumables will allow you to confirm whether the import was successful or not.\n7. On a successful import, the forgettables have been committed to the estimate. Otherwise, no actions will be taken with data and you can try again."
